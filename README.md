## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Window closes immediately  
**Solution:** Make sure you have images in `1- newclean-main/scans/` folder first

**Issue:** Python not found  
**Solution:** Install Python 3.8+ from python.org and check "Add Python to PATH"

**Issue:** Colors look wrong  
**Solution:** Use `1- newclean-main` (latest version) - older versions have inferior color handling

**Ready?** Copy your images to `1- newclean-main/scans/` and run `START_HERE.bat`!
